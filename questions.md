1. What is the limits of Omega, the strategy domain? I ask in order to perform the integration required to calculate P[Theta_{-0}]
2. Can I quickly calculate this integral using FFT package?
3. Initialize x at the vector of ones.
4. Once we have the parameter dynamics, how do we go to the actual dynamics?

The differential equation is an equation on the parameters. The parameters are my dynamical variables. 

1. What is their domain? Can I initialize theta at [1, 0, 1,1,1...]?
2. For the integration, what is the domain of Omega?
3. The eigenfunctions are eigenvectors of the matrix of polynomial coefficients, multiplied by the corresponding monomials right?
